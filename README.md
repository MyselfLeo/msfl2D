# msfl2D - 2D physics engine (WIP)

msfl2D is a 2D physics engine developed in C++. I
started it as a way to learn good C++ practices and
the fundamentals of real-time physics.

This is still a **work in progress**!

## Project organisation

The repository has 2 directories representing 2 principal
CMake targets: `msfl2D` and `msfl2D-demo`.

As their names suggest, `msfl2D` is the core library
whereas `msfl2D-demo` is an executable using `msfl2D`.

## Library used
`msfl2D` only uses the C++ standard library.

`msfl2D-demo` uses [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) along
with [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for its
graphical interface.

For now, I reserve all rights for this project.
